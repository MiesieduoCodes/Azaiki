It is the powerful understanding of who we are, free from external expectations and judgments. In the gaze of the subject, we see not just a reflection of physical appearance, but the deep-rooted certainty of a woman who has shaped her own path. Her eyes, though not directly engaging the viewer, seem to look beyond, as if lost in thought, yet there is an undeniable firmness in her expression. The subtle distraction adds a layer of complexity to her identity—she is neither fully present nor detached, but grounded in her own world, confident in her own thoughts. Through the lenses of her glasses, her perspective is sharpened, her identity clear, and her presence undeniable. This is a woman who knows her worth, stands firm in her truth, and embodies the essence of self-assurance."

The Ngala series also conveys a message of self-love and empowerment to women. The women in the paintings wear their thorns as crowns, reminding us that the struggles we face in life are also a part of our journey, and we should embrace them without fear or shame. It is a call to every woman to wear her struggles as a badge of honor and use it as a tool for growth and positivity. Millicent's artwork is a beautiful celebration of the resilience and strength of women. It encourages every woman to embrace her beauty and positivity, even amidst life's challenges.
